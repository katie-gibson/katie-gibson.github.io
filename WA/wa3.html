    <h2 id="history"><u>History</u></h2>
    <p>In 1900, there were fewer than 3000 cars on the road in France. To increase the demand for cars and subsequently car tires, two tire manufacturers created a guide for French motorists. The first 35,000 copies were free and provided information like hotels, mechanics, maps, and tire repair.</p>
    <p>After the publication was suspended in WW1, the guides were revised and they started to be sold for $2.15 in 1922. In 1926, the guides started to include fine dining establishments and 10 years later the criteria for the rankings were published:
        <li>☆ "a very good restaurant in its category"</li>
        <li>☆☆ "excellent cooking, worth a detour"</li>
        <li>☆☆☆ "exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey"</li>
    </p>
    <p>The guide paused again during WW2, and after the war expanded into several more countries covering hotels and restaurants all of the world.</p>

    <h3 id="stars">Stars</h3>
    <p>Michelin reviwers visit restaurants anonymously, usually in pairs, and they award one, two, or three stars accordingly. See above under <em>History</em> for the rating criteria. The guide also awards "Rising Stars" for restaurants that have the potential to earn stars.</p>
    <h3 id="green-stars">Green Stars</h3>
    <p>In 2020, Michelin launched "Green Stars" which are a sustainability emblem. These symbolize excellence in sustainable gastronomy, and those awarded with this are given space to describe their restaurant vision.</p>
    <h3 id="bib-gourmand">Bib Gourmand</h3>
    <p>Since 1997, the guide has highlighted restaurants offering "exceptionally good food at moderate prices," which is called "Bib Gourmand."</p>
    <h3 id="the-plate">The Plate</h3>
    <p>In 2016, "The Plate," was added to recognize restaurants that "simply serve good food."</p>
